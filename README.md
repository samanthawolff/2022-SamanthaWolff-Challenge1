# 2022-SamanthaWolff-Challenge1
For this project I was tasked with making Horiseon's code more user friendly and accessible. I was given a starter code to work with and a detailed outline of what they were expecting from me. 
## Running Into Issues:
* The actual issues in the code itself were minimal. Everything worked correctly besides the "Search Engine Optimization" link as seen below. The ID was not linked to that section of the page.

* Semantic tags in the code were almost non-existant so those needed to be added. Nav, section, article, and footer are some examples of some of the tags I added. 

* The CSS for the page had some duplicate code so I consolidated that and organized it to fit the semantic stucture of the html. 
* I also added multiple comments to both the html and css files in order to add even more organization. 
* The 3 images seen in the section I labeled as "content" did not have any alt attributes so I added those.
