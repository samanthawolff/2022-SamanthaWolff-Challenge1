# 2022-SamanthaWolff-Challenge1
For this project I was tasked with making Horiseon's code more user friendly and accessible. I was given a starter code to work with and a detailed outline of what they were expecting from me. 
## Running Into Issues:
The actual issues in the code itself were minimal. Everything initally worked correctly besides the "Search Engine Optimization" navigation link.
